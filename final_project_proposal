Summary:
For my final project I want to make a LED lit infinity mirror with light sensors so when the room is dark, 
the light around the mirror light up. Im getting an LED strip to line the edge of the mirror, 
hopefully sending the light through the glass to illuminate the glass, turning the whole image in 
the mirror the color of the LED instead of just lighting the surface of the mirror 
(and creating a glare or reflection). I am going to use ambient light sensors to determine the 
color/“temperature” of the room and light the mirror a compliment color to the room. 
If the room is red, the mirror will be lit with a green, if the room is lit orange, the mirror 
will light up blue, etc. There will be a mirror layered with a one way mirror to create the illusion 
of an infinite row of lights receding into the mirror. 

Component Parts: 
two way/one way mirror - tap plastics
mirror - tap plastics
frame - ?? build or find readymade that will work
LED strip - jameco 
RGB ambient light color sensors - jameco

Challenges: 
I think that writing the code will be the hardest part and will probably take me the most time. 
After that, wiring everything, then building the frame.

Project Timeline:
Well, because Im gone the last week of school, I have only two weeks to complete my project 
(and I'm doing my best not to panic..)
By next week, Id like to have most of it built and have most of my code written as well. 
Ideally, if the whole thing was built, that would be ideal so I could focus all of my time 
and energy on writing and perfecting the code I need written.
